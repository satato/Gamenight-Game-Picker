To edit the VR games library, simply run the 'update-vr-library.py' file in a terminal and utilize the command-line menu to make changes as you see fit.

The process for editing the Nintendo library is the same, only a different application: 'update-nintendo-library.py'

Once these games libraries are appropriately populated, you can begin asking for game night recommendations! Just run 'gamenight-picky.py' in your terminal and answer the questions :)
